### 👋 Hey there, I'm Dumebi Nwanze

I'm a **Product Engineer** who builds end-to-end web and mobile experiences — from idea to production.  
I care about clean design, practical architecture, and delivering software that actually works in the real world.

- 💻 I work across **frontend, backend, and mobile** — mainly with **Next.js**, **React**, **React Native** and **Flutter**.  
- 🚀 I deploy using modern platforms like **Digital Ocean**, **Vercel**, **Railway**, and **Render**.  
- 🧠 I enjoy learning new tools quickly, reading docs, and figuring things out fast.  
- 🤝 I love collaborating on projects that blend **good UX, solid engineering, and clear product thinking**.  
- 📫 Reach me at **davisnwanze7@gmail.com**
